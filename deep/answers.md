In terms of accessibility and having a backup on other boats in the event of a potential boat data loss, distributing the data around three boats can be beneficial, but it takes up needless space. Instead, if every boat had its own time zone, it would make better use of available capacity.

Each database doesn't need to require more space if the data is split up into three fields based on time periods. Since each database must operate on its own schedule, it may be more effective.


## Partitioning by Hash Value
